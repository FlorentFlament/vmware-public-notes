# VMware public notes

Simplest way I could find to share some notes related to VMware.

## App modernization

This is the group I am now part of. So what does "App modernization"
mean at VMware ?

On [VMware website][5], there is an "App modernization" section in the
"Solutions" tab, as well as the "Products" tab. These sections provide
the following links:

* [Solutions][7]

  - [App Modernization][8] - The "App Modernization solutions" section
    is split into 3 items:

	. [Consume Kubernetes Across Clouds][6] - The (Kubernetes)
      platform management aspect.

	. [Build Cloud-Native Apps][9] - Labs to efficiently write
      cloud-native applications from scratch.

	. [Evolve Existing Apps][10] - Labs to transform legacy
      applications, and adopt modern development patterns.


* [Products][11]

  - App Modernization

	. [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid][17]

    . [Tanzu Observability by Wavefront][14]

	. [Tanzu Application Service][18]

	. [Tanzu Application Catalog][13]

	. [Tanzu Service Mesh][15]

    . [Tanzu Mission Control][12]


Also some products in the "App Modernization" section of the [Products
page][11], though not appearing in the main "Products" roll-down menu:

. [Pivotal GemFire][16]

. [Pivotal tc Server][19]

. [Pivotal App Suite][20]

. [Pivotal RabbitMQ][21]


## Random

Just ordered [Programming the 80386][1] book, written by John
H. Crawford and Patrick P. Gelsinger, the later being current VMware
CEO.

Found [Frank Denneman's blog][2], looks interesting.
* Interesting [discussion about NUMA][4] (Non Uniform Memory Access).

[VMworld 2020][3], from September 29th to October 1st. There's a free
registration; a whole lot of "sessions" are programmed.
